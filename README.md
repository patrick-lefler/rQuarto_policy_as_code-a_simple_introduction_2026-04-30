Expressing organizational compliance rules as executable, version-controlled logic rather than prose documents.

## Introduction

Most compliance programs run on PDFs. This project replaces that model with a working demonstration of Policy as Code — rules expressed as functions that take inputs, evaluate conditions, and return deterministic verdicts. The entry point is deliberately simple: password complexity validation. The argument is not.

## Overview

The document introduces Policy as Code through a six-condition password validation function implemented in C# using regular expressions. Each condition — minimum length, maximum length, uppercase, lowercase, numeric digit, special character — is encoded as a discrete, testable step. The workflow is visualized as a Mermaid flowchart rendered natively in Quarto. The closing sections make the case for why this pattern matters to GRC teams, boards, and engineers: it converts compliance from periodic attestation into continuous, auditable enforcement. The target audience is anyone responsible for the gap between what an organization promises regulators and what it actually does.

## Key Findings

1. **The failure message is the product.** A prose policy that says "passwords must be complex" generates interpretation. A coded policy that returns `FAIL: no special character` eliminates it. That shift — from vague guidance to specific, actionable output — is what compliance teams actually deliver when they adopt this pattern.

2. **Version control is the strongest argument for the approach.** When a policy lives in a Git repository, every change carries a timestamp, an author, and a diff. An auditor can reconstruct the full history of a rule in minutes, not weeks.

3. **The organizational cost is real and worth naming.** Writing policy as executable logic requires compliance professionals to read code and engineers to treat governance as a first-class design input. Neither adjustment is free. Companies that defer this investment will continue to discover compliance gaps during incidents, when remediation is most expensive.
